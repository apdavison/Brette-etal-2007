# Benchmark simulations from Brette et al. (2007)

This repository contains updated code for the benchmark simulations reported in:

  R. Brette and 21 others (2007) Simulation of networks of spiking neurons: A review of tools and strategies. Journal of Computational Neuroscience 23: 349â€“398. [doi:10.1007/s10827-007-0038-6](https://doi.org/10.1007/s10827-007-0038-6)

The original code used in the paper is available as [ModelDB accession number 83319](http://modeldb.yale.edu/83319).
In the time since the original publication, some of the software reviewed is no longer maintained,
other software has been modified, updated, re-written, etc.

The aim of this repository is to provide updated versions of the code, and if possible to check whether or not the results obtained with newer versions of the software match those from earlier implementations.

The conditions under which the original code can be shared and reused are unclear.
For all the code in this repository, we have contacted the original authors and they have agreed to (re)license their code under the MIT License.
